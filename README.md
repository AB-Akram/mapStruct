MapStruct is a Java library designed for generating code, particularly useful in Spring Boot projects. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of mapping data between various Java bean types, such as DTOs, entities, and custom Java objects. By automating mapping tasks, MapStruct reduces the need for manual, repetitive code, making development more efficient. It achieves this by generating optimized mapping code during compilation, leading to better performance and a cleaner codebase without boilerplate mapping logic
